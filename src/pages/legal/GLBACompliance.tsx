        <p>
          The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), also known as the Financial Services Modernization 
          Act of 1999, is a federal law that requires financial institutions to explain how they 
          share and protect their customers' private information. At FuteurCredX, we are committed 
          to full compliance with GLBA requirements.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          This document describes how FuteurCredX complies with the GLBA's Privacy Rule and 
          Safeguards Rule to protect the security and confidentiality of your nonpublic personal
